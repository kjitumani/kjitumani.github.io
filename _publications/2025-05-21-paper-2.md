**Abstract**

We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto
primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe.
Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by
an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and
cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark
matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced
accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially
within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent
framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.
