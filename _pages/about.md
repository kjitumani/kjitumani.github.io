Hello! I am Jitumani Kalita, a Ph.D. research scholar in the Department of Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati.

My research focuses on High Energy Physics and Cosmology, with a specific interest in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). I work on understanding the early universe through the lens of black hole thermodynamics, accretion, and evaporation processes. My goal is to explore how these ancient objects impact the cosmological history of our universe.

Currently, I am working on revisiting PBH accretion and evaporation models to understand their cosmological consequences more precisely.

Beyond Physics
======
While I spend most of my time simulating the universe, I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I start my day with yoga to keep my mind centered and end it with an evening run to stay active.

I describe myself as a thoughtful introvert who is actively stepping out of my comfort zone to engage more with the scientific community. I am always open to discussing new ideas, physics problems, or potential collaborations!

Research Interests:
======
- Primordial Black Holes: Formation, Evolution, and Constraints

- Hawking Radiation: Semiclassical approximations and greybody factors

- General Relativity: Black hole metrics and spacetime geometry

- Early Universe Cosmology: Inflation and Dark Matter candidates

I am proficient in **Python** and **Mathematica** for cosmological simulations and data analysis.
